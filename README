SQTool is a portable general purpose scripting tool powered by The programming language SQUIRREL.

SQTool is currently in development phase, so any API can change by name and/or by functionality.
see NOTES

This project has successfully been compiled and run on
 * Windows x86 (gcc)
 * Linux x86 (gcc)

The SQUIRREL is included as git submodule in this repository, so don't forget to run one of:
	git clone --recursive https://github.com/atanasovdaniel/sqtool.git
or
	git clone https://github.com/atanasovdaniel/sqtool.git
	cd sqtool
	git submodule update --init --recursive

Unfortunately "Download ZIP" doesn't include the SQUIRREL. You can download it manually - tag v3.1 (or master).
