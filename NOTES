SQtool is internaly UTF-8 only:
- SQUIRREL is configured without SQUNICODE.
- As Windows APIs are natively UCS2/(UTF-16), all strings passed to/from Windows API functions are converted to/from UCS2.

The 'sqtlib' used in sqtool is different from SQUIRREL's 'sqstdlib', but is still compatible to original one.

API changes:
- SQFILE now represents SQStream class, not FILE*. So every class extending SQStream can be accessed by sqstd_xxx API: sqstd_fread, sqstd_fwrite, sqstd_fseek, sqstd_ftell, sqstd_fflush, sqstd_feof, sqstd_fclose
	Two functions are with different parameters - more common API is used, only size to read/write is given instead of size and count: sqstd_fread and sqstd_fwrite.
    Functions sqstd_frelease() is added, it is used to delete stream object.
- Two more methods are added to SQStream to help generalization of stream: Close and _Release. Method _Release is called by sqstd_frelease() and by stream release hooh.

API added:
- Three function are added to iteract with streams - sqt_loadfile_stream, sqt_compile_stream, sqt_readclosure_stream and sqt_writeclosure_stream.
- New SQTStreamReader is implemented based on SQStream. Stream reader gives ability to virtualy 'mark' and 'reset' position of readed SQStream (see sqt_loadfile).
	Functions added: sqtsrdr_create, sqtsrdr_mark, sqtsrdr_reset
- Text reader/writter based on SQStream with support for ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE. Two functions to create streams sqt_textreader and sqt_textwriter.
- Declaration helpers: sqt_declareclass, sqt_declaremembers and sqt_declarefunctions. Also structures to describe class/members declarations - SQTMemberDecl and SQTClassDecl.
- Functions to convert UTF-8 to/from _WIN32-wchar_t

From scripting side:
- Functions loadfile, dofile and writeclosuretofile can allso read/write from stream.
- 'stream' class has two new methods - print and readline
- Added 'streamreader' calss.
- Added 'textreader' and 'textwriter' calss.
- Added 'popen' class.
- Script name is passed as argument 0
