SQtool is internaly UTF-8 only:
- SQUIRREL is configured without SQUNICODE.
- As Windows APIs are natively UCS2/(UTF-16), all strings passed to/from Windows API functions are converted to/from UCS2.

The 'sqtlib' used in sqtool is different from SQUIRREL's 'sqstdlib', but is still compatible to original one.

API changes:
- SQFILE now represents SQStream class, not FILE*. So every class extending SQStream can be accessed by sqstd_xxx API: sqstd_fread, sqstd_fwrite, sqstd_fseek, sqstd_ftell, sqstd_fflush, sqstd_feof, sqstd_fclose
	Two functions are with different parameters - more common API is used, only size to read/write is given instead of size and count: sqstd_fread and sqstd_fwrite.
- Two more methods are added to SQStream to help generalization of stream: Close and _Release.

API added:
- Three function are added to iteract with streams - sqt_loadfile, sqt_dofile and sqt_writeclosure.
- New SQTStreamReader is implemented based on SQStream. Stream reader gives ability to virtualy 'mark' and 'reset' position of readed SQStream (see sqt_loadfile).
	Functions added: sqtsrdr_create, sqtsrdr_mark, sqtsrdr_reset
- Declaration helpers: sqt_declareclass and sqt_declarefunctions
- Functions to convert UTF-8 to/from _WIN32-wchar_t

From scripting side:
- Functions loadfile, dofile and writeclosuretofile can allso read/write from stream.
- 'stream' class has two new methods - print and readline
- Added 'streamreader' calss.
- Added 'popen' class.
- Script name is passed as argument 0

Content of 'sqtlib' folder:
- sqstdblob.cpp - minor changes - tailored to SQStream.
- sqstdblobimpl.h - minor changes - tailored to SQStream.
- sqstdio.cpp - left only FILE/'file' related functions, added popen SQFPipe/'popen'.
- sqstdstream.cpp - all SQStream/'stream' functionality moved here.
- sqstdsystem.cpp - OS specifics.
- sqt_decl.c - Helpers for class/functions declaration.
- sqt_squirrelio.cpp - SQUIRREL-I/O functions aka loadfile, dofile and writeclosuretofile.
- sqt_streamreader.cpp - SQTStreamReader class
- sqt_wstr.c - _WIN32 UTF-8 to/from wchar_t helpers
